## [Introduction](#introduction) 
This repository contains source code for a Java project that focuses on Intermediate concepts, codes and exercises.

#### Course Description:
This course is a continuation of CCPRGG1L - Fundamentals of Programming. The course covers advanced topics in Java to train students in developing robust programs. Topics to be covered include recursion, regular expression, basic object-oriented principles, graphics, and multithreaded programming.

#### Course outcomes:
At the end of the course, the studend must be able to:
1. Create a program that uses recursions and regular expressions
2. Implement Object-Oriented in program design
3. Create and document application that uses a modern graphical user interface (GUI)
